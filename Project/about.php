    <p style="font-family: 'Palatino Linotype'">The proposed project aims to design and develop a modern, web-based Point of Sale (POS)
        system tailored for a supermarket chain. This system will streamline sales transactions,
        inventory management, and promotional activities through a user-friendly interface accessible
        from any web-enabled device. The primary goal is to enhance operational efficiency, improve customer
        satisfaction, and support the supermarket's growth by leveraging technology.</p>
